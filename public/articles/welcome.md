# Welcome
Welcome to my blog!

There is nothing to see here for now, but I'm working on it.

Right now, you can appreciate some beautifully formatted markdown.

# Heading 1
This is css:
```css
h2:before {
    content: "## ";

    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .75);

    margin-left: -45px;
    margin-right: .5rem;

    font-family: var(--font-default);
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Heading 2
This is something inside the second heading `h2`
